<h1> Publication Pitch</h1>

<h2> What is the idea for a publication?</h2>
<p>A publication for Millenials in NYC.</p>
<h2>Who is your audience?</h2> 
<p>The concept of Millenial is quite broad - it can be anyone born between 1980's and the 2000's who lives in NYC.</p>
<h2>Is there a similar publication? If yes, how will your publication differentiate itself from the existing publication?</h2>
<p>The biggest publication for Millenials is Mic. But Mic's audience is nationwide, while our publication would be focused in NYC. We could explore the city's diversity reflected on social, economic and cultural issues. Also, readers could pitch stories and contribute with them, sharing their own experiences and thoughts.</p>
<h2>Give a few general examples of pieces that might run on this site.</h2>
<p>The Millenial Job Census: Where millenials are employed in NYC? How much they earn? What are their main concerns about the job market? This could be an interactive project with charts, tables, maps and multimedia content.</p>
<p>NYC's Emerging Artists: what kind of new artistic movements are there in NY? We could create an interactive calendar with concerts/plays/exhibitions of emerging artists in the city. This could also show a map of where these things are going on and multimedia content about them. The website could also have a Google From where new artists could tell us about their work.</p>
<p>How Millenials access the health system in NYC? How many don't have health insurance? What are the most used services, what do they need more? Another interactive project with charts, tables, maps and multimedia content.</p>
